t1 = Miners new generation public chain node mining
t2 = Unnecessary coin exchange|stable earnings|free exit
t3 = Be committed to creating the largest, global DeFi platform integrated with  DEX IMO and DAO.
t4 = Introduction to mining
t5 =   Miners are a new generation of node mining methods. It is a dual combination of IPFS miner and CPU miner. It is also a new mining method after Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is mainly for token holders who adopt the USDT storage consensus mechanism public chain. , Miners is a hard fork of UNI, which aims to eliminate the inherent defects of UNI and simplify the user threshold. Every user can obtain benefits through node participation in on-chain calculations. Users only need to join the community to become virtual miners. The miner fee is connected to the mining interface of the community node, and the USDT digital asset on the chain is used for calculation. However, every user can get benefits. USDT deposits in its own wallet, does not transfer “0” risk, flexibly exits, and is more free, and contributes to the DEFI ecology without hardware construction. High cost and complicated configuration, which can generate millions of dollars in revenue for users every year.
t6 = Our advantages
t7 = Safe and secure

t39 = 1: "Miners" is a new generation of node pool mining mode, mainly oriented to mining
      Public chains that use USDT to store consensus mechanisms, and holders of such public chains,
      You can gain benefits through on-chain nodes and hold more USDT
      More, the longer the holding time, the greater the calculation power, the higher the income.
t40 = 2: zero risk mining USDT deposit their wallet without transferring money out
      Go, "0" risk, flexible exit more freely
t41 = 3: customers do not need complicated procedures, first choose a good public chain and need to pay one
      Second miner fee can complete mining node docking.
